> UI pattern library for Modem sites and apps

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/radiomodem/patterns.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/radiomodem/patterns)

## Development

The following instructions assume that you have already installed Node.js on your computer. If this is not the case, please download and install the latest stable release from the official [Node.js download page](http://nodejs.org/download/). If you are using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) you can also install Node.js via the command line:

```sh
$ brew install node
```

> __Notice__: It is important that you install Node in a way that does not require you to `sudo`.

Once you have Node.js up and running you will need to install the local dependencies using [npm](http://npmjs.org):

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Tasks

#### Build - `npm run build`
Compiles all library assets using Gulp.

#### Watch - `npm run watch`
Watches the assets for changes and runs the appropriate Gulp tasks.
